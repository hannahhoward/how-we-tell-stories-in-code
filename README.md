# How We Tell Stories In Code

### Setup Instructions

Really easy!

In a web browser (tested in Chrome), open index.html! (you don't even need to start a web server)

For speaker notes, open a second browser window. Open the index.html, and then add ?presenter&timer to the end or the URL -- you will get speaker notes and a timer! When you changes slides in one window the other window will also update!

Recommend reading speaker notes as the presentation is mostly visual.
